# Weighted Job Scheduling
An advanced algorithms assignment problem. More constraints added to the classic weighted job scheduling problem. It was required to find a solution to this problem with both recursion and dynamic program. Furthermore, time and space complexity were added constraints.

# Added Constraints
The added constraints and requirements were:
  * Minimum shift break (minimum time between shifts).
  * Maximum shift length (max time a worker could be working).
  * Maximise profit.
  * Jobs were of a number of days length. Each day was a different cost of hiring that worker for that day.
  * Workers could be kept on shift even if there was no job if this maximised profit.
